A browser-based golf swing analyzer built with Next.js, TailwindCSS and Konva.js. 

Video playback is completely client side - there is no video uploading or server side integration required. Swing lines are drawn using canvas with the help of Konva.js.

There is no state management library used - just old fasioned prop drilling. In the future I plan to add more features which will likely lead to redux or another state management solution.
